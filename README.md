## Ideation

Goal is to build an AI tool that turns a name or URL into a CISO ready description and a security briefing with sources. To help CISOs approve new tools they’ve never seen before.

1. Input: Product name or URL.
2. Resolves the correct product and who makes it.
3. Classifies the software into categories.
4. Produces a concise security summary with sources.

Product description + usage

- Vendor reputation
- CVE history + trends
- Incidents / abuse signals
- Data handling + compliance
- Deployment + admin controls
- 0–100 trust/risk score with rationale
- Confidence rating
- Suggest 1–2 safer alternatives with short rationales.

AI to lookup high signal sources like

- PSRIT
- Terms of service/data processing agreement
- Systems and organization controls type II
- ISO attestations
- Reputable advisories/CERTS
- CISA known exploited vulnerabilities catalog


- Use a lightweight local cache
Can be CLI but web page would be a bonus.
